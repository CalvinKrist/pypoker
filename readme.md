# Italian Poker game

Traditional italian poker game (5 card draw variant) written in Python (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_draw).

This project started as an excuse for me to learn Python.
The goal is to have a working version of the game, where users can connect to the server remotely joining a game room with other players and play.

Any comment, suggestion, idea much appreciated.
